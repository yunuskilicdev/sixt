###### Assumptions

**isAnagram** functions checks if two texts are anagram.

**Eleven plus two** and **Twelve plus one** are anagram. So my solution is case-insensitive.

If one of the texts is empty, it returns false.

**Madonna Louise Ciccone** and **One cool dance musician** is famous anagram example. Space counts are different in each text. So I ignore space character when I check.

There is a lite version of anagram which is called **isAnagramLite** inside Anagram class. It checks only lengths of the text, space is important and case-sensitive.

I added maven file for junit dependency management. There are lots of test cases in the test section.
